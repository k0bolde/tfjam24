Hey, who is this guy?
Some Guy: Rrrrgh!
Huh. You’re not sure if he’s feral or high, but he seems to want to fight!
Pean: But before that, hey, I’m Pean, your helpful tutorial character! I’ll pop up here and there to give you some helpful tips and tricks. Sorry, can’t help in the fight! Or any others.
Pean: Anyways, to win, you want to get this guy’s HP to 0 while not hitting 0 yourself. Wow! You do this by using moves to do damage. Some moves cost MP - mutagenic points, no magic here! Give it a go!
