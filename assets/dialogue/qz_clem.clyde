Is that…Clem? She looks a little different.

Clem: Hey there, cutie! You caught my other side! I knew you wouldn’t be able to stay away.

Clem: Ask about -

+ Drug
	Clem: I never dealt here, only offered my special services. Interested?
	<-
+ Strange Markings
	Clem: Careful if you see a pentagram! Just interacting it will summon a powerful witch. She won’t let you off easy, but I’m sure you can take care of her! Gosh, you’re strong!
	<-
+ Door
	Clem: Keep an eye out for a shortcut door! It’ll take you to and from halfway through the block!
	<-
+ Appearance
	Clem: This is how I dress for other occasions. How do you think I look?
	<-
+ Other Synths
	Clem: Keep an eye out for a lost synth tail. If you’re not careful, it’ll attach you and convert you to its former owner! But maybe you want that to happen? Being a synth is the best!

+ Bye
