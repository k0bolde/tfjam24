???: Help! Someone help!
?????: Shut up, bot!
You turn the corner. Two armed mutants are attacking a poor sultry service synth!
Jesse: Looks like she could use our help! What do you think?
Finley: Might as well!
Tutorial Pean: Uh oh, these fellas look more dangerous! Luckily, I have something that might help. Your characters have natural resistances that means certain attack types do half damage to them. The same applies to enemies!
Tutorial Pean: Equipment (which aren’t implemented) can also grant resistances.
Tutorial Pean: If a character or enemy is targeted with an attack type that matches their weakness, the attacker gets an extra turn and the attack also does 50% more damage. Wow!
Tutorial Pean: Experiment and figure out what these enemies’ resistances and weaknesses are. To give you a hint, the cat with a gat is weak to fire. Fire up that pussy!
